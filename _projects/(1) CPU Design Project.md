# About
We were tasked with create two different type of simple single core processors. The first was a single cycle processor, where each instruction took one clock cycle to complete.
## Role
I was in charge of a few different parts, one was the ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) for the processor. I was also in charge of validation testing the other components of the processor that my teammates made.
