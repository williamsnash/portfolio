# About
We were tasked with making a rumba navigate a course without hitting any of the obstacles. We had access to a lidar sensor, a radar sensor, and the bump sensors on the front of the rumba, the rumba also had cliff detection sensors on the bottom of the rumba. We had to write the code to enable the registers so that the rumba would allow us to read the data from the sensors. We then wrote code to allow a user to drive the rumba around the course attempting to avoid the obstacles.
## Role
I personally worked on the navigation code, allowing the rumba to see objects, I was also the driving for the final navigation aspect of the project.
